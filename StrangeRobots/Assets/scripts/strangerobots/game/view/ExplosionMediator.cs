//Mediators provide a buffer between Views and the rest of the app.
//THIS IS A REALLY GOOD THING. READ ABOUT IT HERE:
//http://thirdmotion.github.io/strangeioc/faq.html#why-mediator

//This mediates between the app and the ExplosionView.

//Note that we're not pooling PlayerView explosions (nor PlayerViews), since they
//are relatively rare in the game.
