//Since we have an injectable RoutineRunner, we can move
//some behaviours that should be Controllers out of the classification of View.

//Here's an example. This mechanism simply waits a few seconds, then spawns a new enemy.
//Since it's pure controller, there's no good reason for it to be taking up space/
//cycles in the visual portion of the game. So we simply write it as a Controller
//and inject in the MonoBehaviour bit.
