//Create the ShipView

//NOTE: We're not using pools to create the ShipView. Arguably we should...
//or at least store the single instance. As a practical matter, Ship creation
//and destruction is "rare" in game terms, happening only when the player gets
//killed or on the turnover of a level. The wastage of resources is therefore trivial.
