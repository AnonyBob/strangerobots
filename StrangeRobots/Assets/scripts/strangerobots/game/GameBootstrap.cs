//Every context starts by attaching a ContextView to a GameObject.
//The main job of this ContextView is to instantiate the Context.
//Remember, if the GameObject is destroyed, the Context and all your
//bindings go with it.

//This ContextView holds the core game. It is capable of running standalone
//(run from game.unity), or as part of the integrated whole (run from main.unity).
